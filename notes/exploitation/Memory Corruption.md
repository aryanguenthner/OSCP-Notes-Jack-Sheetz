# Buffer Overrflows
> Tips and tricks to succesfully exploit buffer overflows


- Goal is to aim to write aribitrary code into the EIP register as this is the CPU register that stores the address of the next instruction to be executed
	- if we can overwite this address we can direct the program to execute code in any location we are able to overflow

- the ESP register stores the address of the current stack frame
	- basically is what controls the scope of local variables

- most often associated with a memory operations in code like copying a string or moving data that accidentally overwrites other existing data in an unintended area of memory



## Windows Buffer Overflows
- main mode of discovery is fuzzing
	- looking for applicatino crashes
- generally want to fuzz any input field the application offered

- Have to know exactly which part of the buffer is landing in the EIP register
	- 2 Methods:
		- **Binary Tree Analysis** -> splitting identified size of crash-causing buffer in half with two characters recursively until the exact address is identified
			- i.e. if the crash causing buffer was 800 chars, 400 A's and 400 B's would be sent in the same payload. If overwritten by B's, then that portion of the buffer would be split into 200 B's and 200 C's, etc. until we reach the exact bytes are identified that are overwriting the buffer. 
		- **Unique Pattern Iteration** -> uses a ruby script to generate unique sequence of 4 byte chunks equal to the size of the crash-causing buffer identified
			- this allows an easier way to identify exactly where the overwrite occurs according to which unique string of chars is written to EIP
			- ```/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/msf-pattern_create.rb -l [crash-causing buff size]```
			- ```/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/msf-pattern_offset.rb -l [crash-causing buffer] -q [hex representation overwrote to EIP]```

#### Buffer Overflow Protection Mechanisms on Windows
- DEP -> Data Execution Protection
	- hardware/software that perform extra memory access checks to make sure code is not execution from data pages
- ASLR -> Address Space Layout Randomization
	- randomizes the base address of a program and it's DLL's every time it is loaded so that exploitation of a statis memory address is not feasible
	- This is not implemented on WinXP
- CFG -> Control-Flow Guard 
	- prevents code from branching and overwriting memory address pointers
