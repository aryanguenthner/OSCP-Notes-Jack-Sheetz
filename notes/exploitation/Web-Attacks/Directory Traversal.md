# Directory Traversal
> Tips for exploiting Directory Traversal. This is very often tied in with LFI and RFI- if directory traversal is found be sure to properly test for RFI/LFI as that can be an entry point.


- You cannot "go too far back" with ../ sequences
- rule of thumb is to get 10-15 of them before you add the file at the end
	- if no success. double the sequence count before the filename
	- i.e. ```../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd```

- files always on a system: 
	- (Windows) -> C:\boot.ini
	- (Windows) -> c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
	- (Linux) -> /etc/passwd
